To use neuropointillist on AWS, run each of these programs in this order:
00_dockerbuild  (this builds a local docker container)
01_createECRRegistry (this creates a registry on AWS for the container, which is not necessary if you publish it to another container registry)
02_createNpointBatchQueue (this creates an AWS batch queue using spot pricing, so that you can submit your jobs with wild abandon)
