    "The full dataset has 10 subjects at 2 timepoints (test and retest) completing 1 run each of 5 different tasks. To save processing time, we will just use 4 subs (sub-01 through sub-04) and 1 task (overtwordrepetition) at both timepoints. \n",

    "We also want to use the data that has already been preprocessed using fmriprep. To see these files from [v0001 of the data on OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000114/versions/00001), click on FMRIPREP (under Analyses on the right side of the screen), poldracklab/fmriprep:0.5.4 - #9, Results, fmriprep. \n",
