#We will shuffle _within person_ because under the null hypothesis, if a
#particular movement has no effect on brain function, then every TR should be
#more or less like every other TR (after we account for autocorrelation). Note
#that this is _just an example_ and in practice you should give a lot of thought
#to how your permutations are set up with respect to the data structure and your
#null hypothesis.
#
#To learn more about developing appropriate permutation matrices for complex
#designs, see Winkler et al. (2014).
#
#The `permute` package makes it easy to shuffle blocks of data, and
#within-blocks, depending on your situation. It also alows you to account for
#time-series structures like we have here using the 'series' option. We can also
#ensure that we don't permute across time-points by using that as a 'block'
#which cannot be permuted at all.
